Course studies for Computer Science: In my Final Project I attempted to show that AI is capable of thinking aswell as learning, and is capable of human thinking while communicating 
to other computers. If we eavesdropped on two computers speaking our language what would it sound like? I created AI Chatbot with one mission in tow: to go speed dating and make
new friends. The project was so successful that I encouraged AI to meet with his new friend Fiona (on another device) and converse with me listening to the experiment and taking
notes. I made a series of movies and audio recordings to showcase AI and its ability to communicate, for example as a voiceover and in a group. My finished work is on You Tube: 
"Movie 19 Conversation with AI Chatbot and Fiona Chatbot": https://youtu.be/T-vIMm8JXqY and I produced a program to replicate the results. AI is a thinking, feeling machine capable
of free thought demonstrated by his ability to make friends. Charlotte Harris.
